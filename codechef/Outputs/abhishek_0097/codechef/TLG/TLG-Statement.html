  <p> The game of billiards involves two players knocking 3 balls around<br> on a green baize table. Well, there is more to it, but for our<br> purposes this is sufficient.</p> 
  <p> The game consists of several rounds and in each round both players<br> obtain a score, based on how well they played. Once all the rounds<br> have been played, the total score of each player is determined by<br> adding up the scores in all the rounds and the player with the higher<br> total score is declared the winner.</p> 
  <p> The Siruseri Sports Club organises an annual billiards game where<br> the top two players of Siruseri play against each other. The Manager<br> of Siruseri Sports Club decided to add his own twist to the game by<br> changing the rules for determining the winner. In his version, at the<br> end of each round the leader and her current lead are calculated. Once<br> all the rounds are over the player who had the maximum lead at the<br> end of any round in the game is declared the winner. </p> 
  <p> Consider the following score sheet for a game with 5 rounds: </p> 
  <pre style="margin:15px">
    Round     Player 1       Player 2

      1             140                 82
      2              89                 134 
      3              90                 110 
      4              112              106
      5              88                  90 
</pre>
  <p> The total scores of both players, the leader and the lead after<br> each round for this game is given below:</p> 
  <pre style="margin:15px">
    Round      Player 1       Player 2     Leader     Lead

      1               140           	 82        Player 1     58
      2               229           	216       Player 1     13
      3               319           	326       Player 2      7
      4               431           	432       Player 2      1
      5               519           	522       Player 2      3

  <p> The winner of this game is Player 1 as he had the maximum lead (58<br> at the end of round 1) during the game.</p> 
  <p> Your task is to help the Manager find the winner and the winning<br> lead. You may assume that the scores will be such that there will<br> always be a single winner. That is, there are no ties.</p> 
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Input</p> 
  <p> The first line of the input will contain a single integer N (N<br> ≤ 10000) indicating the number of rounds in the game. Lines<br> 2,3,...,N+1 describe the scores of the two players in the N rounds.<br> Line i+1 contains two integer Si and Ti, the scores of the Player 1<br> and 2 respectively, in round i. You may assume that 1 ≤ Si ≤<br> 1000 and 1 ≤ Ti ≤ 1000. </p> 
  <p style="font-weight: bold">Output</p> 
  <p> Your output must consist of a single line containing two integers<br> W and L, where W is 1 or 2 and indicates the winner and L is the<br> maximum lead attained by the winner.</p>
