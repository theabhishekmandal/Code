  <p><strong>The following problem appeared in the <a href="http://www.codechef.com/MARCH09/">CodeChef March '09 Challenge</a></strong></p> 
  <p>In the mysterious country of Byteland, everything is quite different from what you'd </p> 
  <p>normally expect. In most places, if you were approached by two mobsters in a dark alley, they would </p> 
  <p>probably tell you to give them all the money that you have. If you refused, or didn't have any - </p> 
  <p>they might even beat you up.</p> 
  <p> In Byteland the government decided that even the slightest chance of someone getting injured has to be ruled out. So, they introduced a strict policy. When a mobster approaches you in a dark </p> 
  <p>alley, he asks you for a specific amount of money. You are obliged to show him all the money that </p> 
  <p>you have, but you only need to pay up if he can find a subset of your banknotes whose total value </p> 
  <p>matches his demand. Since banknotes in Byteland can have any positive integer value smaller than </p> 
  <p>one thousand you are quite likely to get off without paying.</p> 
  <p>Both the citizens and the gangsters of Byteland have very positive feelings about the system. No one ever </p> 
  <p>gets hurt, the gangsters don't lose their jobs, and there are quite a few rules that minimize that<br> probability of getting mugged (the first one is: don't go into dark alleys - and this one is said to work in other places also).</p> 
  <h3>Input</h3> 
  <p> The first line contains integer <i>t</i>, the number of test cases (about 100). Then <i>t</i> test cases follow. Each test case starts with <i>n</i>, the </p> 
  <p>number of banknotes in your wallet, and <i>m</i>, the amount of money the muggers asked of you. Then <i>n</i> </p> 
  <p>numbers follow, representing values of your banknotes. Your wallet does not hold more than 20 banknotes, and the value of a single banknote is never more than 1000.</p> 
  <h3>Output</h3> 
  <p> For each test case output a single line with the word 'Yes' if there is a subset of your banknotes that sums to <i>m</i>, and 'No' otherwise.</p>
